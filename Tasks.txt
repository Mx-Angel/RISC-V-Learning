RISC-V Assembly Learning Plan (RV32I focus)
1. Hello World (syscall basics)

    Goal: Use ecall to write "Hello World" to stdout.

    Skills:

        Basic .data and .text sections

        Loading addresses with la

        Using a0, a1, a2 for syscall arguments

        Setting a7 to syscall numbers

    Why: Learn the bare minimum to talk to the OS.

2. Print a Number

    Goal: Store an integer in memory and print it to stdout.

    Skills:

        Memory storage (.word, .byte)

        lw / li usage

        Converting integers to strings (simple loop or fixed lookup table)

    Why: First step toward working with non-string data.

3. Read User Input

    Goal: Prompt for a number or short string and echo it back.

    Skills:

        Syscall for read

        Writing into a buffer

        Understanding ASCII codes

    Why: Introduces input handling.

4. Simple Arithmetic Calculator

    Goal: Read two integers, add them, print the result.

    Skills:

        add, sub, mul, div

        Stack usage for temporary storage

        More advanced branching

    Why: Brings together input, math, and output.

5. Conditional Logic

    Goal: Check if a number is even or odd and print the result.

    Skills:

        andi, beq, bne

        Signed vs unsigned comparisons (blt, bltu, etc.)

    Why: Teaches control flow.

6. Loops

    Goal: Print numbers from 1 to N.

    Skills:

        Loop setup with addi and branches

        Counters and comparisons

    Why: Loops are essential for real programs.

7. Array Operations

    Goal: Store an array of numbers in memory, sum them, print the sum.

    Skills:

        Address arithmetic

        lw with offsets

        Keeping track of array length

    Why: Teaches how to navigate data structures in memory.

8. String Processing

    Goal: Reverse a string entered by the user.

    Skills:

        Pointer manipulation

        Loops with char buffers

        lbu vs lb

    Why: Practice with char arrays and byte operations.

9. Multi-File Assembly

    Goal: Have a main program call a function in another .S file.

    Skills:

        Using jal / jalr

        Calling conventions (save/restore registers)

        Linking multiple object files

    Why: Gets you into reusable code and modular design.

10. Mini Text-Based Game

    Goal: A small “Guess the Number” game.

    Skills:

        Random number generation (you can fake it with a counter or syscall)

        Input parsing

        Loops and conditionals in a bigger program

    Why: Brings together everything — IO, loops, branching, memory, and functions.

How to Build This Up

    Start with qemu-riscv32 + riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc/as/ld so you don’t need a full VM.

    Keep each program in its own folder with .S source, a Makefile, and maybe a README for your notes.

    Once you hit Project 6–7, start using gdb-multiarch with QEMU for debugging.

    When you reach Project 9–10, try using C + Assembly mix to see how they interact.
